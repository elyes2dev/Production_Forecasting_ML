## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on forecasting production quantities for Sagemcom using various machine learning techniques. The project involves extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the development of predictive models to accurately forecast production quantities.

## Project Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted thorough EDA to understand data patterns, identify trends, and prepare data for modeling.
- **Model Development:**
  - **XGBoost:** Implemented XGBoost for robust and efficient production forecasting.
  - **ARIMA and SARIMA:** Utilized ARIMA and SARIMA models for time series forecasting, capturing both seasonal and non-seasonal patterns.
  - **LSTM:** Leveraged TensorFlow's LSTM for deep learning-based predictions, capturing long-term dependencies in production data.
- **Model Comparison:** Performed detailed comparisons of model performance to identify the most accurate and reliable prediction method.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow**
- **XGBoost**
- **ARIMA/SARIMA**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (for visualization)
